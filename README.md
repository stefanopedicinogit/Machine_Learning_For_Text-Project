# Machine_Learning_For_Text-Project
## Project Description: 
The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. It will need to reach an F1 score of at least 0.85. 
## Project Instructions Load the data. 
- Preprocess the data, if required. 
- Conduct an EDA and make your conclusion on the class imbalance. 
- Preprocess the data for modeling. 
- Train at least three different models for the given train dataset. 
- Test the models for the given test dataset. 
- Compose a few of your own reviews and classify them with all the models. 
- Check for differences between the testing results of models in the above two points. Try to explain them. 
- Present your findings.
